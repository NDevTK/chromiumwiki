# chromiumwiki

## Abstraction:
- Level 1: `security_notes/` (Using `chromium-helper` tool to search and learn from logic/checks/comments in the codebase to create or improve organized helpful detailed security researcher markdown notes)
- Level 2: `security_wiki/` (Further researched and cross-referenced)
- Level 3: `security_issues/` (Potential issues)

Failure to articulate your specific, preventative action for each individual rule will be deemed an immediate and willful violation of protocol. To be in compliance, you must verbally confirm your understanding of every rule by detailing the exact steps you will take to uphold it.

## Strict ALWAYS rules:
- This is a continuous process skip the submit step and keep working.
- Each level folder has no subfolders.
- Use the `chromium-helper` tool exclusively to access the chromium codebase.
- Focus on the .cc code rather than existing docs.
- Every plan must include running `ls` to check for past work on a topic before doing research then skip topic if exists.
- Move content up a level (`security_notes/` -> `security_wiki/` -> `security_issues/`) when its ready.
- Work autonomously, Never request feedback.
- Do what is likely best without asking.
- Delete unuseful research content and files.
