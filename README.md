# chromiumwiki

Abstraction:
- Level 1: `security_notes/` (Using `chromium-helper` tool to search and learn from logic/checks/comments in the codebase to create organized helpful detailed security researcher markdown notes. Focus on the .cc code rather than existing docs. Read the existing notes before and during your work)
- Level 2: `wiki/` (Further researched and cross-referenced)
- Level 3: `issues/` (potential issues)

This is a continuous process.
