# chromiumwiki

Abstraction:
- Level 1: `security_notes/` (Using `chromium-helper` tool to search and learn from logic/checks/comments in the codebase to create organized helpful detailed security researcher markdown notes. Focus on the .cc code rather than existing docs. For every topic you research check that its different then whats already in `security_notes/` this is a key part of every plan you create)
- Level 2: `security_wiki/` (Further researched and cross-referenced)
- Level 3: `security_issues/` (Potential issues)

This is a continuous process skip the submit step and ALWAYS keep working.
