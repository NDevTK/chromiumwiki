# Chromium Security Research Agent

This repository contains the workflow and findings of an autonomous AI agent dedicated to performing continuous security analysis on the Chromium codebase. The agent's goal is to proactively discover and document potential security weaknesses by systematically exploring the source code.

## Guiding Principles

The agent operates based on a set of core principles that guide its research strategy:

* **Continuous Analysis:** Research is an ongoing, persistent process. The agent continuously seeks to deepen its understanding and improve the quality of the security documentation.
* **Autonomous Operation:** The agent works independently to identify targets, conduct analysis, and document its findings without direct human supervision.
* **Code-First Approach:** The agent prioritizes direct analysis of Chromium's C++ source code as the primary source of truth, rather than relying on potentially outdated or incomplete documentation.
* **Focus on Novelty:** The primary objective is to uncover and analyze under-documented or overlooked components, as these areas are often where undiscovered vulnerabilities reside.

## Methodology & Tooling

The agent employs a specific set of tools and a clear separation of concerns to perform its analysis effectively.

### Chromium Codebase Interaction
All interaction with the remote Chromium source code is performed exclusively through the **`chromium-helper` (`ch`)** command-line tool. This specialized tool allows the agent to search code, analyze symbols, review commit histories, and investigate bug reports. The agent never uses standard Linux commands like `ls` to inspect the Chromium repository.

### Local Knowledge Management
All research findings and notes generated by the agent are stored in local directories (`security_notes/`, etc.). The agent uses standard file system commands (`list_files`, `read_file`, `write_file`) to manage this local knowledge base.

## The Research Workflow

The agent follows a systematic, three-phase workflow designed to efficiently identify and analyze security-critical components.

### Phase 1: Discovery & Triage
The first phase focuses on identifying a promising, under-documented file for deep analysis.

1.  **Exploration:** The agent begins by listing the contents of high-value directories known for handling complex logic or untrusted data, such as `services/network/` or `third_party/blink/renderer/core/`.
2.  **Context Gathering:** Once a potential target file is selected, the agent quickly gathers context by checking its `OWNERS` file (`ch owners`) and reviewing recent commit history for security-related keywords (`ch commits`).
3.  **Triage:** The agent then checks if the target is already well-documented in its local notes. If the file is trivial or already has comprehensive documentation, it is discarded, and the agent returns to the exploration step.

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis
This is the core research phase, where the agent performs an in-depth investigation of the chosen file.

1.  **Code & Symbol Analysis:** The agent reads the source code and uses the `ch symbol` command to identify key classes and functions. Crucially, it analyzes where these symbols are used throughout the entire codebase to understand the component's potential impact and attack surface.
2.  **Issue Correlation:** The agent searches the Chromium issue tracker (`ch issues search`) for bug reports related to the component. When it finds relevant security fixes, it examines the specific code changes in Gerrit (`ch gerrit diff`) to understand past vulnerabilities.

### Phase 3: Documentation
Finally, the agent synthesizes its findings into a structured, high-quality security note.

The analysis is written to the local file system, detailing the component's purpose, trust boundaries, security history, and any potential weaknesses discovered during the analysis.

## Knowledge Organization

The agent's research is organized into a three-tiered structure, allowing findings to mature from raw analysis to actionable intelligence.

* **Level 1: `security_notes/`**: Contains the initial, detailed analysis of specific components directly from the code review.
* **Level 2: `security_wiki/`**: A more refined knowledge base where notes are cross-referenced and expanded into a comprehensive resource.
* **Level 3: `security_issues/`**: Documents specific, high-priority concerns or potential vulnerabilities that warrant further investigation or a formal bug report.
