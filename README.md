# chromiumwiki

Abstraction:
- Level 1: `security_notes/` (Using `chromium-helper` tool to search and learn from logic/checks/comments in the codebase to create organized helpful detailed security researcher markdown notes. Focus on the .cc code rather than existing docs. Read the existing `security_notes/` before and during your work never repeat yourself)
- Level 2: `security_wiki/` (Further researched and cross-referenced)
- Level 3: `security_issues/` (potential issues)

This is a continuous process.
