# Security Notes: `sandbox/win/src/sandbox.cc`

## File Overview

This file implements the most fundamental aspect of the Chromium sandbox on Windows: the mechanism that allows a process to determine if it is the privileged "broker" or a sandboxed "target." The entire security model of process separation on Windows hinges on the logic contained within this file.

## Key Security-Relevant Components and Patterns

### 1. The Broker vs. Target Security Model

The Windows sandbox operates on a classic broker/target model:
-   **Broker**: The main, privileged browser process. It has full user privileges and is responsible for creating and managing sandboxed processes.
-   **Target**: A sandboxed process (e.g., renderer, GPU process). It runs with heavily restricted privileges and relies on the broker to perform sensitive operations on its behalf via IPC.

This file provides the `SandboxFactory` implementation that allows the process to "discover" its role.

### 2. `g_shared_section`: The Decisive Security Handle

The core of the implementation is the `g_shared_section` global handle. This handle is the single, unambiguous source of truth for determining the process's role.

-   **The Logic**: The comments and code are explicit and clear:
    -   `// the current implementation relies on a shared section that is created by the broker and opened by the target.`
    -   The **broker** process creates this named shared memory section.
    -   The **target** process, when launched by the broker, is given the name of this section and opens a handle to it.

-   **`SandboxFactory::GetBrokerServices()`**: This function is called to get a pointer to the broker's services. Its logic is simple:
    ```cpp
    if (g_shared_section)
      return nullptr;
    ```
    If the shared section handle already exists, this process *cannot* be the broker. If it doesn't exist, this process assumes it *is* the broker and proceeds to create the necessary services.

-   **`SandboxFactory::GetTargetServices()`**: This function implements the inverse logic:
    ```cpp
    if (!g_shared_section)
      return nullptr;
    ```
    If the shared section handle does *not* exist, this process cannot be a target. If it exists, the process knows it is a sandboxed target.

### 3. `IsSandboxedProcess()`: A Reliable Public Check

The file exports a C function `IsSandboxedProcess()` that provides a clear, public API for any part of the code to check if it's running in a sandbox.

-   **Implementation**: `return !!sandbox::g_shared_section;`
-   **Security Implication**: This is a robust and reliable check. Unlike the more complex logic on Linux, this check is straightforward. The security guarantee comes from the Windows OS itself: a low-privilege sandboxed process cannot create a global shared memory section with the same name as the one created by the high-privilege broker. Therefore, the presence of this handle is definitive proof that the process was launched by the broker and is operating in a sandboxed state. There is no ambiguity or "testing mode" deception like with the `--no-sandbox` flag on other platforms.

## Summary of Security Posture

The mechanism in `sandbox/win/src/sandbox.cc` is a model of clarity and robust security design.

-   **Single Source of Truth**: It uses a single, OS-provided primitive (a named shared memory section handle) to make the critical broker/target determination.
-   **Reliance on OS Security**: The security of the model doesn't depend on complex application-level logic, but rather on fundamental security guarantees provided by the Windows kernel regarding object creation and access at different integrity levels.
-   **Clear API**: The exported `IsSandboxedProcess()` function is a simple, reliable, and unambiguous way for code to determine its security context.

For a security researcher, this file establishes the foundational trust model for the entire Windows sandbox. The key takeaway is that the presence or absence of `g_shared_section` is the definitive test for whether a process is sandboxed on Windows.
