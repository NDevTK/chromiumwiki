# Security Notes: `mojo/core/ports/name.cc`

## File Overview

This file is foundational to the Mojo `ports` layer. It defines the basic data structures for `PortName` and `NodeName`, which are the unique identifiers for message endpoints (ports) and processes (nodes) within the Mojo IPC system. While the file itself contains minimal logic, the concepts it defines are at the heart of the system's security model.

## Key Security-Relevant Components and Patterns

### 1. 128-bit Identifiers for Unguessability

- **`PortName` and `NodeName`**: Both identifiers are defined as a structure containing two 64-bit unsigned integers (`v1` and `v2`), creating a 128-bit address space.

- **Security Implication**: The use of a 128-bit identifier is a critical and deliberate security design choice. A large, sparse address space makes it computationally infeasible for an attacker in a sandboxed process to guess the name of a valid port in another process. This is the primary defense against a malicious process attempting to connect to or hijack an arbitrary IPC channel. The security of the entire `ports`-based communication depends on the unguessability of these names.

### 2. Explicit Invalid Name Constants

- **`kInvalidPortName` and `kInvalidNodeName`**: The file defines constant values `{0, 0}` to represent an invalid port and node name, respectively.

- **Security Implication**: This is a fundamental security best practice. By having a well-defined, globally recognized "invalid" state, the system can unambiguously check whether a port or node reference is valid before using it. This helps prevent a wide class of bugs, including:
    - **Null Pointer-like Dereferences**: Prevents logic from attempting to route messages to a default-initialized or zeroed-out name.
    - **Confused Deputy Attacks**: Ensures that a component cannot be tricked into sending a message to a default or predictable "zero" address which might be listened on by a malicious entity. It forces all connections to be made to explicitly generated, non-trivial names.

## Summary of Security Posture

The file `mojo/core/ports/name.cc` is deceptively simple. While it contains no complex code, it establishes two of the most important security pillars of the Mojo `ports` subsystem:

1.  **Identifier Unguessability**: The 128-bit `PortName` and `NodeName` are the foundation for preventing unauthorized access to IPC channels. The actual generation of these names (which happens elsewhere) must use a cryptographically secure random source to fulfill this security promise.
2.  **Unambiguous Invalid State**: The `kInvalidPortName` and `kInvalidNodeName` constants eliminate ambiguity about the validity of an endpoint, which is crucial for robust error handling and preventing attacks that exploit default or uninitialized states.

A security researcher reviewing this file should recognize it as the specification for the "keys" to the IPC kingdom. The critical follow-up investigation is to audit the *generation* of these names to ensure they are generated with sufficient entropy (e.g., using `base::UnguessableToken` or a similar mechanism) to live up to the security promise of their 128-bit size.
