# Security Analysis of `turn_port.cc`

This document provides a security analysis of the `turn_port.cc` file. This file implements the `TurnPort`, which is responsible for allocating and managing a relayed candidate through a TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) server. The `TurnPort` is a critical component for enabling connectivity when direct P2P connections fail, and its security is essential to prevent misuse of the TURN server and protect the client.

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

The `TurnPort`'s primary security function is to securely authenticate with the TURN server.

- **STUN Authentication:** The implementation correctly uses the STUN long-term credential mechanism.
  - An initial `Allocate` request is sent, and if the server challenges with a 401 Unauthorized, the `OnAuthChallenge` function (line 1453) correctly parses the `REALM` and `NONCE`.
  - It then computes a `hash` based on the username, realm, and password, which is used to add a `MESSAGE-INTEGRITY` attribute to subsequent requests (`AddRequestAuthInfo`, line 1169).
  - **Security Implication:** This is a standard and robust mechanism that prevents unauthorized clients from using the TURN server and protects the integrity of the STUN/TURN messages against tampering by an off-path attacker.

## 2. Protection Against Malicious Servers and Redirection

A key threat model is a malicious or compromised TURN server attempting to attack the client. The `TurnPort` implementation contains several crucial defenses.

- **Alternate Server Redirection (`OnTryAlternate`, line 1490):** The port handles the `STUN_ERROR_TRY_ALTERNATE` response, which instructs the client to use a different server. The security checks in `SetAlternateServer` (line 810) are critical:
  - **Loopback Address Blocking:** It explicitly blocks any redirection attempt to a loopback address (e.g., `127.0.0.1`). This is a **vital security control** that prevents a malicious server from tricking the client into attacking services running on its own machine.
  - **Redirection Loop Prevention:** It keeps a record of `attempted_server_addresses_` to prevent infinite redirection loops.

- **Local Network Access Permission (`PrepareAddress`, line 347):** Before connecting to a TURN server (especially one resolved from a hostname), the port calls `MaybeRequestLocalNetworkAccessPermission`.
  - **Security Implication:** This is the primary defense against DNS Rebinding attacks. If an attacker-controlled DNS server resolves the TURN server's hostname to a private IP address, this check prevents the client from blindly connecting and sending data into the user's local network. The security of this mechanism depends on a correct implementation of `LocalNetworkAccessPermissionFactory` by the browser or application.

- **Disallowed Ports (`AllowedTurnPort`, line 998):** This static method implements a policy that restricts TURN connections to a set of allowed ports (e.g., 80, 443, and unprivileged ports > 1024). This is a defense-in-depth measure that prevents a malicious server from redirecting the client to a sensitive, well-known port on another machine.

## 3. TURN Protocol Security Model

The implementation correctly adheres to the TURN security model, which prevents the relay from being used as an anonymous proxy for attacks.

- **Permissions:** The `TurnPort` creates a `TurnEntry` for each peer it communicates with. This entry is responsible for sending a `CreatePermission` request to the TURN server for the peer's IP address (`TurnEntry::SendCreatePermissionRequest`, line 1803). The TURN server will then only relay traffic to peers for whom a permission exists. This is the fundamental mechanism that prevents an attacker from using the relay to launch attacks against arbitrary third parties.

- **Channel Binding:** For performance, the port can establish a "channel" to a peer, which uses a lightweight header. This is only done after a `CreatePermission` request has been successful, so it does not bypass the core security model.

## 4. `TurnCustomizer` Hook

- **`TurnCustomizerMaybeModifyOutgoingStunMessage` (line 1315):** This function provides a hook for the embedding application to modify STUN messages before they are sent.
- **Security Risk:** This is a powerful but potentially dangerous feature. A buggy or malicious `TurnCustomizer` could remove or alter security-critical attributes like `MESSAGE-INTEGRITY`, or add attributes that create a security vulnerability. The overall security of the `TurnPort` is therefore dependent on the correctness and trustworthiness of the `TurnCustomizer` implementation, if one is provided.

## Summary of Potential Security Concerns

1.  **Reliance on External Security Checks:** The security of the `TurnPort` against DNS Rebinding and SSRF attacks is entirely dependent on the externally-provided `LocalNetworkAccessPermissionFactory`. A weak or absent implementation of this check would create a major vulnerability.
2.  **`TurnCustomizer` Risk:** The `TurnCustomizer` hook represents a significant risk, as it allows for the arbitrary modification of security-critical STUN messages. Any application using this feature must ensure its implementation is secure.
3.  **Malicious TURN Server:** While the client has defenses, a malicious TURN server can still cause denial of service by dropping traffic or refusing to create allocations. Using an encrypted transport (`turns://`) is essential to prevent a man-in-the-middle from intercepting or modifying TURN traffic.
4.  **Complexity:** The TURN state machine (allocating, authenticating, refreshing, creating permissions, binding channels) is complex. The implementation in `TurnPort` and `TurnEntry` has many states and asynchronous operations, which increases the potential for subtle bugs.
