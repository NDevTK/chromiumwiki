# Security Analysis of `sandbox_seccomp_bpf_linux.cc`

This document provides a security analysis of the `sandbox_seccomp_bpf_linux.cc` file. This file is a central component of Chromium's sandboxing architecture on Linux. It is responsible for selecting and applying the appropriate seccomp-bpf (secure computing mode with Berkeley Packet Filter) policy for different types of sandboxed processes. This mechanism is the core of the Linux sandbox, restricting the system calls a process can make and thus containing the damage from a compromised renderer or other utility process.

## 1. Sandbox Policy Dispatching

The most critical function of this file is to act as a dispatcher, mapping a process type to a specific, tailored security policy.

- **`PolicyForSandboxType` (line 185):** This function is the heart of the component. It contains a large `switch` statement that takes a `sandbox::mojom::Sandbox` type (e.g., `kRenderer`, `kGpu`, `kNetwork`) and returns the corresponding `BPFBasePolicy` object.
- **Security Implication:** This is the **primary security decision point** for the Linux sandbox. The integrity of the entire sandboxing model rests on this function correctly assigning the most restrictive policy possible to each process type. A logic error here, such as assigning a permissive policy (e.g., the GPU policy) to a more sensitive process (e.g., the renderer), would create a major vulnerability by granting the process access to system calls it does not need, thereby widening its attack surface.

## 2. Principle of Least Privilege in Policies

The design demonstrates a strong commitment to the principle of least privilege by using a wide variety of highly specialized policies.

- **Specialized Policies:** Instead of a few generic policies, the file includes headers for many specific policies, such as `BpfAudioPolicy`, `BpfCdmPolicy`, and `BpfPrintCompositorPolicy`. This ensures that each process type is granted access to only the narrow set of system calls required for its specific task.
- **Hardware-Specific GPU Policies:** The `GetGpuProcessSandbox` function (line 125) further refines this principle. On ChromeOS, it dynamically selects a more restrictive policy based on the GPU vendor (AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, etc.). This is a critical security hardening measure, as different GPU drivers require different `ioctl` commands. A generic policy would have to allow the union of all drivers' required syscalls, which would be significantly weaker than a vendor-specific policy. This specialization is a key defense for the highly complex and historically vulnerability-prone GPU process.

## 3. Post-Activation Sandbox Verification

- **`RunSandboxSanityChecks` (line 260):** For high-risk process types like the renderer and GPU, this function is called immediately after the sandbox is enabled. It performs several checks to confirm that the sandbox is active and functioning as expected.
- **Security Implication:** This is an excellent defense-in-depth measure that acts as a tripwire. The checks are designed to fail in a way that crashes the process if the sandbox is not working correctly. For example, it attempts to call `fchmod` on an invalid file descriptor. Without a sandbox, this would fail with `EBADF`. With the sandbox active, the syscall should be blocked, resulting in `EPERM`. If the check fails, the process is terminated, preventing it from continuing to run in a dangerously unsandboxed state.

## 4. Compile-Time Security Assertions

- **`BUILDFLAG(USE_SECCOMP_BPF)`:** The entire file's functionality is conditionally compiled based on this flag, ensuring that this sandboxing mechanism is only built for supported Linux architectures.
- **`#error` Directive (line 86):** The code includes a preprocessor `#error` directive that will fail the build if `USE_SECCOMP_BPF` is disabled on an architecture where it is expected to be supported (e.g., x86-64, ARM64). This is a strong security assertion that prevents developers from accidentally creating an insecure build by misconfiguring the build flags.

## Summary of Potential Security Concerns

1.  **Policy Correctness:** The most significant risk lies not in this file, but in the individual policy files it includes (e.g., `bpf_renderer_policy_linux.cc`). A bug in one of those policies—such as allowing a dangerous syscall or an overly broad argument to a permitted syscall—would create a sandbox escape vulnerability. The security of this dispatcher is entirely dependent on the correctness of the policies it dispatches.
2.  **New Process Types:** When a new sandboxed process type is added to Chromium, it is absolutely critical that it is added to the `PolicyForSandboxType` switch statement with a new, bespoke, and maximally restrictive policy. Forgetting to add an entry or defaulting to a generic policy would be a significant security regression.
3.  **The `--no-sandbox` Flag:** The `IsSeccompBPFDesired` function (line 156) correctly respects the `--no-sandbox` command-line flag. While essential for debugging, this flag represents a global "off switch" for this critical security layer. Malicious software on a user's machine could attempt to launch Chrome with this flag to bypass the sandbox entirely, though this is an external threat against which the browser itself has limited defenses.
