# Security Analysis of `partition_alloc.h`

This document provides a security analysis of the `partition_alloc.h` header file. This file serves as the top-level entry point for the PartitionAlloc system but delegates most of its logic to the `PartitionRoot` class. The most critical security aspect of this file is not its code, but the extensive comments that lay out the fundamental security and memory-safety philosophy of the entire allocator, especially concerning Memory Tagging Extensions (MTE).

## 1. The "Slot" vs. "Object" Security Boundary

The core security principle articulated in this file is the strict separation between two concepts: the "slot" and the "object."

-   **Slot:** An internal, indivisible unit of allocation managed by PartitionAlloc. It is represented as a raw address (`uintptr_t`) and is explicitly **not** MTE-tagged. This allows the allocator to perform necessary pointer arithmetic on its internal metadata.
-   **Object:** The user-facing region of memory returned by `malloc()` or `new`. This memory is contained *within* a slot. It is represented as a typed pointer (e.g., `void*`) and **is** MTE-tagged.

-   **Security Implication:** This separation creates a **critical security boundary**. The MTE tag on the "object" ensures that any access by application code is checked by the hardware. An attacker who manages to corrupt a pointer can only access memory within the valid, tagged bounds of that object. They cannot access the raw, untagged "slot" memory, which contains sensitive allocator metadata like freelist pointers. This prevents an entire class of heap exploitation techniques where an attacker overflows an object to corrupt the allocator's internal metadata.

## 2. Secure Transitions Between Worlds

The "housekeeping rules" mandate the use of specific functions to transition between the tagged "object" world and the untagged "slot" world.

-   **`PartitionRoot::ObjectToSlotStart()` and `PartitionRoot::SlotStartToObject()`:** These functions are the designated, secure gateways. They are responsible for not only calculating the offset between the slot and the object but, more importantly, for correctly **adding or stripping the MTE tag** during the conversion.

-   **Discouragement of Unsafe Primitives:** The comments explicitly warn against the direct use of lower-level primitives like `UntagPtr()` or `reinterpret_cast`.

-   **Security Implication:** This establishes a secure read/write barrier for the allocator itself. By forcing all conversions through these specific functions, the design ensures that MTE tags are managed correctly and consistently. A bug in this logic, or a developer failing to use these gateways, could lead to tag confusion or the accidental exposure of an untagged pointer to user code, which would create a vulnerability. This disciplined approach is essential for maintaining the integrity of the MTE-based security guarantees.

## Summary of Potential Security Concerns

1.  **Correctness of the Gateway Functions:** The security of the slot/object boundary depends entirely on the flawless implementation of the `ObjectToSlotStart` and `SlotStartToObject` functions. A bug in their MTE-tagging logic would undermine the entire model.
2.  **Developer Discipline:** The model relies on all PartitionAlloc developers adhering to the "housekeeping rules." Any deviation, such as using `reinterpret_cast` instead of the approved gateway functions, could introduce a security vulnerability.
3.  **Security of `PartitionRoot`:** This file establishes the high-level security philosophy, but the actual implementation of all memory management, metadata protection (like freelist pointer poisoning), and security checks resides within the `PartitionRoot` class. The overall security of the allocator depends on the correctness of that much larger and more complex component. This header correctly identifies `PartitionRoot` as the place where the core logic lives.
