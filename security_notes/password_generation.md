# PasswordGenerationManager (`components/password_manager/core/browser/password_generation_manager.cc`)

## 1. Summary

The `PasswordGenerationManager` is a stateful controller that manages the lifecycle of a newly generated password, from the moment it is created and accepted by the user in the UI to the point it is permanently saved (committed) to the `PasswordStore`. It does not generate the password string itself, but rather orchestrates the complex "presave-then-commit" flow. Its primary security responsibility is to handle username conflicts, preventing a generated password from accidentally overwriting an existing credential for a different account on the same site.

## 2. Architecture: A "Presave-then-Commit" State Machine

The manager's architecture is designed to be robust against data loss (e.g., if the user closes the tab after generating a password but before submitting the form) and to handle security edge cases safely.

1.  **Generation and Acceptance**: The flow begins when the user accepts a generated password in the UI. The `PasswordManagerDriver` calls `GeneratedPasswordAccepted` on the manager.

2.  **Conflict Resolution**: Before doing anything else, the manager performs its most critical security check: it looks for username conflicts (`FindUsernameConflict`).
    *   **No Conflict**: If the username on the form does not match any existing credential for that site, the flow proceeds directly to the "presave" step.
    *   **Conflict Detected**: If a credential with the same username already exists, the manager **stops** the automatic flow. It clears the username from the pending credential and uses a special `PasswordDataForUI` class to construct and show an "Update password?" bubble. This forces the user to make an explicit decision about whether they intend to update the existing account's password.

3.  **Presave**: If there is no conflict, the manager immediately calls `PresaveGeneratedPassword`. This creates a temporary, "presaved" entry in the `PasswordStore`. This entry is a complete `PasswordForm` but is treated as provisional. The manager stores a copy of this form in its `presaved_` member variable, which represents the core of its state. This ensures that if the user navigates away, the generated password is not lost.

4.  **Commit**: After the user successfully submits the registration form, the `PasswordSaveManager` (acting as a `FormSaver`) calls `CommitGeneratedPassword`.
    *   This method takes the final, submitted `PasswordForm`.
    *   It uses the `presaved_` data as the "old primary key" to find and update the temporary entry in the `PasswordStore`, effectively making it a permanent, normal credential. This two-phase process ensures atomicity.
    *   It also logs UMA metrics about how the user might have edited the generated password before submission.

5.  **Cancellation**: If the user cancels the flow (e.g., by clearing the form field), `PasswordNoLongerGenerated` is called, which finds and removes the `presaved_` entry from the store, cleaning up the temporary state.

## 3. Security-Critical Logic

The manager's security posture is defined by its careful handling of potential credential overwrites.

*   **Username Conflict Resolution**: This is the component's single most important security feature. By explicitly checking for `FindUsernameConflict` and halting the automatic save process, it prevents a scenario where a user, while creating a *new* account, could be tricked into overwriting the password for an *existing* account if the form pre-filled with the existing account's username. The use of the `PasswordDataForUI` model to show a dedicated prompt is a strong, user-facing security control.

*   **Handling Password Changes on Conflict**: A clever and subtle security mechanism exists for the specific case where a username conflict is detected on a form that is also detected as a "change password" form. In this scenario, `PresaveGeneratedPassword` creates the presaved entry with a **random string** as its username element. This prevents the temporary, presaved credential from matching and overwriting *any* real credential in the database while it's in its provisional state, adding another layer of defense against data corruption.

*   **State Integrity**: The `presaved_` member variable is the link between the initial generation and the final commit. The integrity of this state is critical. If this state were to be corrupted or lost, the manager would be unable to find the correct provisional entry to update, potentially leading to an orphaned temporary credential or a failure to save the final password. The class's simple, well-defined lifecycle methods (`Presave`, `Commit`, `PasswordNoLongerGenerated`) ensure this state is managed correctly.

## 4. Triggering Generation: `PasswordGenerationFrameHelper`

While the `PasswordGenerationManager` handles the *saving* of a generated password, the `PasswordGenerationFrameHelper` is the component responsible for the *triggering* of the feature. It lives alongside the `PasswordManagerDriver` and acts as the direct interface to the renderer for all generation-related events.

*   **Determining Generation Availability (`IsGenerationEnabled`)**: This is the primary security gate for the feature. Before any UI is shown, this method is called to ensure a strict set of preconditions are met:
    1.  The user must be able to save passwords (i.e., the password store is working).
    2.  The user must have password saving enabled in settings.
    3.  The feature must be enabled by the `PasswordFeatureManager` (which often implies the user is signed-in and syncing).
    4.  The current URL must **not** be a `google.com` domain, as a hardcoded security measure to avoid interfering with Google's own account management flows.

*   **Processing Site-Specific Requirements**: The helper is responsible for gathering password requirements that will be used to generate a compliant password.
    *   `ProcessPasswordRequirements` receives Autofill server predictions for the fields on a form. If these predictions include password requirements (e.g., `max_length`, required character classes), they are stored in the `PasswordRequirementsService`.
    *   This allows Chrome to learn from crowdsourced data what kind of password a specific website expects.

*   **Generating the Password String (`GeneratePassword`)**: When the user requests a password, this method is called.
    1.  It retrieves any stored requirements for the specific site and form from the `PasswordRequirementsService`.
    2.  It calculates the final password length, respecting the `max_length` attribute from the HTML form field and the server-provided requirements.
    3.  It calls the low-level `autofill::GeneratePassword(spec)` function, passing it the final specification. This function is responsible for the actual cryptographic random string generation.

*   **Communication with `PasswordFormManager`**: After the `PasswordFormManager` parses a form, if it identifies a field as a new password field (e.g., on a registration form), it calls `password_generation_helper->AddManualGenerationEnabledField()`. This is how the helper learns which specific fields on the page are allowed to display the "Suggest strong password" UI.
