# Security Analysis of `sandbox/policy/linux/sandbox_linux.cc`

## Summary

`sandbox_linux.cc` is the master controller and central coordinator for the entire Linux sandboxing infrastructure in Chromium. It is one of the most security-critical files in the codebase, responsible for orchestrating the complex, multi-layered process of locking down a process before it handles untrusted data. Its primary role is to ensure that various sandboxing primitives (namespaces, seccomp-bpf, setuid) are initialized in the correct order and that the sandbox is irreversibly "sealed" at the right moment.

## The Core Security Principle: A Multi-Layered, Phased Approach

The Linux sandbox is not a single mechanism but a defense-in-depth strategy composed of several independent layers. The `SandboxLinux` class is responsible for enabling these layers in a specific, carefully-ordered sequence.

1.  **Pre-initialization (`PreinitializeSandbox`)**: This is the first phase. It runs early in the browser's startup process and performs initial checks to determine what sandbox features are available on the host kernel (e.g., seccomp-bpf support, Yama ptrace restrictions). It also acquires a file descriptor to `/proc` (`proc_fd_`), which is essential for later stages.

2.  **Namespace Sandboxing (`EngageNamespaceSandbox`)**: This phase, when requested, uses Linux namespaces to isolate the process. It creates a new user namespace, which is a prerequisite for creating other types of namespaces (like PID and network namespaces). Crucially, this function asserts that the process is single-threaded, which is a vital security check to prevent another thread from holding open file descriptors that could be used to escape the sandbox.

3.  **Seccomp-BPF Initialization (`StartSeccompBPF`)**: This is the heart of the sandbox. This phase loads a seccomp-bpf filter into the kernel, which permanently restricts the set of system calls the process is allowed to make. The `SandboxLinux` class is responsible for selecting the correct policy for the given process type (e.g., renderer, GPU) and loading it.

4.  **Sealing the Sandbox (`SealSandbox`)**: This is the final, irreversible step. The `SealSandbox` method closes the `proc_fd_` file descriptor. This is a critical security measure because this descriptor provides powerful introspection and manipulation capabilities. Once it is closed, the sandboxed process has no way to re-open it, permanently cutting it off from this powerful resource.

## Key Security-Critical Functions and Concepts

### `InitializeSandbox`

This is the main entry point for sandboxing a process. Its security rests on several key checks:

*   **Single-Threaded Assertion**: It contains a hard `CHECK` that the process is single-threaded before proceeding. This is arguably the most important check in the entire file. A multi-threaded process could have file descriptors or other resources held open by another thread that are not visible to the main thread, creating a hole that could be used to bypass the sandbox. The code is so strict about this that it will crash the process if it detects multiple threads in a context where it's not explicitly allowed (like the renderer).

*   **No Open Directories (`HasOpenDirectories`)**: Before applying the seccomp-bpf filter, it checks that no unexpected directories are open. An open directory handle could allow a sandboxed process to bypass filesystem restrictions.

*   **Address Space Limitation (`LimitAddressSpace`)**: It attempts to set `RLIMIT_DATA` to restrict the amount of memory the process can allocate. This is a mitigation against certain classes of exploits that rely on large memory allocations, such as heap spraying.

### The Syscall Broker

For syscalls that are required for a process to function but are too dangerous to allow directly (e.g., `open`), the sandbox uses a **syscall broker**. `SandboxLinux` manages the interaction with this broker.

*   `StartBrokerProcess`: This function spawns a separate, more privileged process (the broker).
*   `HandleViaBroker`: When the seccomp-bpf policy is being built, this function is used to specify that a particular syscall should be "trapped" and forwarded to the broker process via IPC. The broker then performs the syscall on behalf of the sandboxed process after validating the arguments. This maintains the principle of least privilege by ensuring that the sandboxed process never gets direct access to dangerous syscalls.

### `proc_fd_`: A Handle with Great Responsibility

The `proc_fd_` member, a file descriptor to `/proc`, is a recurring theme. It is used for many setup tasks, such as checking the thread count and setting up namespaces. Holding this handle is a powerful capability, which is why `SealSandbox`'s job of closing it is so critical to the security of the final sandboxed state.

## Conclusion

`sandbox_linux.cc` is the master choreographer of Chromium's Linux sandbox. Its security relies on the strict enforcement of a phased initialization process, with the single-threaded assertion being the most critical precondition. By coordinating multiple overlapping security mechanisms (namespaces, seccomp-bpf, broker process, resource limits), it builds a formidable barrier against renderer exploits. Any change to the order of operations or the security checks within this file could have catastrophic consequences for the integrity of the entire sandbox.
