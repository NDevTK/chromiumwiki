# Security Analysis of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

## Overview

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a fundamental security mechanism of the web platform that allows servers to specify which origins are permitted to access their resources. It is a critical feature that enables the modern, interconnected web while still enforcing the security boundaries of the same-origin policy. This document analyzes Chromium's implementation of the CORS protocol, focusing on the key components responsible for its enforcement.

## The `CorsURLLoader`: The Heart of CORS Enforcement

The `CorsURLLoader` class, located in `services/network/cors/cors_url_loader.cc`, is the central component for handling all CORS-enabled requests in Chromium. It acts as an interceptor that wraps the actual network request, ensuring that all the necessary CORS checks are performed before the response is delivered to the renderer.

### Key Responsibilities of `CorsURLLoader`:

-   **CORS Flag Determination**: The `SetCorsFlagIfNeeded` method is the initial decision point. It determines if a request is cross-origin and requires CORS handling by comparing the initiator's origin with the target URL's origin. It also correctly handles exceptions for origins that are on an allowlist (e.g., Chrome extensions).

-   **Preflight Orchestration**: It determines if a CORS preflight `OPTIONS` request is necessary by calling the `NeedsPreflight` function. If a preflight is required, it delegates the task to the `PreflightController`.

-   **Response Validation**: It is responsible for validating the final response from the server by calling the `cors::CheckAccess` function, which performs the core CORS checks.

-   **Redirect Handling**: It contains complex and security-critical logic for handling redirects, ensuring that CORS policies are re-evaluated at each step of a redirect chain.

## The CORS Preflight Mechanism

For requests that can have side effects on the server (e.g., those using methods other than `GET`, `HEAD`, or `POST`, or those with custom headers), CORS requires a "preflight" request.

-   **`NeedsPreflight`**: This function, within `cors_url_loader.cc`, is the primary decision point for triggering a preflight. It correctly implements the logic from the Fetch standard, checking for:
    -   Non-safelisted HTTP methods.
    -   Non-safelisted request headers.
    -   The newer Private Network Access (PNA) requirements, which also trigger a preflight.

-   **`PreflightController`**: When a preflight is needed, the `CorsURLLoader` passes the request to the `PreflightController`. This specialized class is responsible for:
    -   Constructing and sending the `OPTIONS` request with the appropriate `Access-Control-Request-*` headers.
    -   Processing the server's response, validating the `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers.
    -   Caching the preflight result to avoid redundant `OPTIONS` requests for a certain period (as specified by the `Access-Control-Max-Age` header).

## Response Validation: `cors::CheckAccess`

The core of the CORS validation logic resides in the `cors::CheckAccess` function, located in `services/network/public/cpp/cors/cors.cc`. This function is called by the `CorsURLLoader` when it receives the final response from the server.

### Key Validation Checks:

-   **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`**: This is the most critical check. The function ensures that the value of this header either matches the request's initiator origin exactly or is the wildcard `*`. It correctly handles the "null" origin and provides detailed error messages for various failure modes, such as multiple origins being specified in the header.

-   **`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`**: If the request was made with credentials (e.g., cookies), this function enforces that the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header is present and has the value `true`. It also correctly implements the security constraint that the wildcard `*` cannot be used for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` when credentials are included.

## Security Implications and Conclusion

Chromium's implementation of CORS is robust, secure, and well-aligned with the Fetch standard.

-   **Layered Security**: The architecture demonstrates a strong layered security model, with the `CorsURLLoader` acting as a high-level orchestrator, the `PreflightController` handling the specialized preflight logic, and the `cors::CheckAccess` function performing the final, critical validation.

-   **Secure by Default**: The logic correctly implements a "secure by default" posture. If any of the CORS checks fail, the request is terminated, and a network error is returned to the renderer.

-   **Clarity and Modularity**: The separation of concerns between the different components makes the implementation clear, maintainable, and easier to audit for security vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, the CORS implementation in Chromium is a mature and well-engineered system that plays a vital role in enabling the modern, interconnected web while upholding the fundamental security principles of the same-origin policy. Its adherence to the specification and its robust error handling make it a strong defense against cross-origin attacks.
