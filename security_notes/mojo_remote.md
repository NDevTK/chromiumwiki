# Security Analysis of `mojo::Remote`

This document analyzes the security properties of `mojo::Remote`, as defined in `mojo/public/cpp/bindings/remote.h`. The `Remote` is the fundamental class for making method calls on a remote mojom interface. It is the non-associated counterpart to `AssociatedRemote`.

## Overview

The `Remote` class is a proxy that allows C++ code to call methods on an object in another process as if it were a local object. It is responsible for serializing method calls, sending them over a message pipe, and handling responses.

### Key Components:

-   **`Remote<Interface>`**: The main, user-facing class template. It provides a high-level API for binding, unbinding, and making method calls.
-   **`internal::InterfacePtrState`**: The internal class that holds the core logic of a remote. It is owned by the `Remote`.

## Internal Architecture

A `Remote`'s logic is almost entirely delegated to an `internal::InterfacePtrState` object. This class manages the lazy initialization of the core Mojo bindings machinery, including the `MultiplexRouter` and `InterfaceEndpointClient`.

For a detailed analysis of these internal components and their interactions, see **`mojo_internals.md`**.

## Security-Relevant Observations

The security considerations for `Remote` are very similar to those for `AssociatedRemote`.

### 1. State Management: Bound vs. Connected

This is the most critical and potentially confusing aspect of the `Remote`'s design.

-   **`is_bound()`**: Indicates that the `Remote` is configured with a message pipe endpoint. It gives no guarantee about the state of the remote end.
-   **`is_connected()`**: This is the only reliable way to know if the connection is still active.
-   **Security Implication**: Calls made on a bound but disconnected `Remote` are **silently dropped**. This is a major potential source of security vulnerabilities. If a developer checks `is_bound()` and assumes it's safe to make a critical call (e.g., a call that performs a security check or revokes a permission), that call may never actually happen if the remote end has disconnected. This can lead to the application being in an insecure state. **It is essential to check `is_connected()` before making any security-critical calls.**

### 2. Lifetime of Remote and Callbacks

-   **Pending Callbacks**: The `Unbind()` method `CHECK`s that there are no pending response callbacks. If a remote is unbound while it is waiting for a response, the response callback will never be invoked. This can lead to memory leaks or use-after-free vulnerabilities. This `CHECK` will crash the process, which is a safe default, but it highlights a significant pitfall for developers.
-   **Remote Lifetime**: The documentation explicitly states that response callbacks will **never** run after the `Remote` object has been destroyed. If a developer makes a call and needs the response, they **must** keep the `Remote` object alive until the response is received.

### 3. Idle Handler

-   **`set_idle_handler()`**: This feature allows the user to be notified when the remote end has been idle for a certain amount of time. This can be used to implement timeouts and to clean up resources associated with idle connections.
-   **`reset_on_idle_timeout()`**: This is a convenient helper that automatically resets the `Remote` when it times out.
-   **Security Implication**: The idle handler can be a useful defense against certain types of resource-exhaustion DoS attacks.

### 4. Versioning

-   **`QueryVersion()`** and **`RequireVersion()`**: These methods allow the `Remote` and `Receiver` to negotiate the version of the interface they are using. `RequireVersion()` is particularly interesting from a security perspective as it can be used to prevent downgrade attacks.

## Summary of Security Posture

`Remote` is a powerful and convenient tool for IPC, but its asynchronous nature and complex state management create several potential security pitfalls.

-   **Bound vs. Connected**: This is the most significant source of potential vulnerabilities. Developers must be vigilant about checking `is_connected()` before making critical calls.
-   **Callback Lifetimes**: The lifetime of the `Remote` object is tied to the lifetime of its response callbacks. This must be managed carefully to avoid bugs and security issues.
-   **Pending Callbacks on Unbind**: The `CHECK` in `Unbind()` is a good defense, but it highlights a dangerous pattern that developers must avoid.
-   **Versioning**: The versioning mechanism provides a defense against downgrade attacks.

A security review of code using `Remote` should focus on verifying that the connection state is checked correctly, that the lifetime of the `Remote` is managed properly with respect to its callbacks, and that the versioning mechanism is used where appropriate to prevent downgrade attacks.
