# Security Notes: `v8/src/trap-handler/handler-outside.cc`

## File Overview

This file is one half of a critical V8 security feature: the trap-based bounds checking mechanism. This feature is a key mitigation against memory corruption. When V8's JIT compiler generates code, it can replace explicit bounds checks with memory accesses that are designed to fault (trap) if they go out of bounds. This file implements the "outside" part of the system, which is responsible for managing the metadata that the actual trap handler needs to safely handle these faults.

The file's header contains an explicit warning about its security sensitivity, indicating that changes must be reviewed by the security team. This is a strong signal of its importance.

## The "Outside" vs. "Inside" Security Model

The trap handling mechanism is split into two parts for security reasons:

-   **`handler-outside.cc` (this file)**: This code runs as part of the normal V8 engine. Its job is to prepare and maintain data structures that describe which memory accesses are protected. It operates under normal conditions and can use standard library features like `malloc` and locks.
-   **`handler-inside.cc` (not this file)**: This is the highly-restricted code that runs *inside* the actual OS signal/exception handler (e.g., `SIGSEGV` handler). This code is extremely constrained and cannot allocate memory or take complex locks. Its security and reliability depend entirely on the integrity and correctness of the data structures prepared by the "outside" code.

This separation is a classic security design pattern that minimizes the complexity of the code running in the most privileged and sensitive context (the signal handler).

## Key Security Mechanisms and Patterns

### 1. Metadata Management for Protected Code

The core purpose of this file is to maintain a database of all JIT code regions and the specific instructions within them that are protected by the trap handler.

-   **`gCodeObjects`**: A global array that acts as the central database. Each entry points to a `CodeProtectionInfo` structure.
-   **`CodeProtectionInfo`**: This struct is the critical piece of metadata. It contains:
    -   The `base` address and `size` of a JIT-compiled code object.
    -   An array of `ProtectedInstructionData`, which identifies the exact offset of every memory access instruction within that code that is allowed to trap.
-   **`RegisterHandlerData()`**: This function is called by the V8 compiler whenever it generates new JIT code with protected instructions. It allocates a `CodeProtectionInfo` struct, populates it, and stores it in the `gCodeObjects` table.

The security guarantee is that when a fault occurs, the "inside" handler can look at the faulting instruction pointer, find the corresponding `CodeProtectionInfo` in this table, and verify that the faulting instruction is one of the registered protected instructions. If it is, the fault is handled safely; if not, it's a real crash.

### 2. Secure State Management and Thread Safety

Given that JIT compilation can happen on multiple threads, protecting the global metadata is critical.

-   **`MetadataLock`**: This lock is used within `RegisterHandlerData` and `ReleaseHandlerData` to ensure that the `gCodeObjects` array is not corrupted by concurrent modifications. A failure in this locking could lead to a race condition where the handler reads inconsistent data, potentially causing it to misinterpret a fault.
-   **`EnableTrapHandler()`**: This function contains a critical security pattern:
    ```cpp
    bool can_enable = g_can_enable_trap_handler.exchange(false, ...);
    TH_CHECK(can_enable);
    ```
    This ensures that the trap handler can only be initialized **once**, and very early in the process's lifecycle. The comments explain that this prevents a dangerous situation where code might be generated with the assumption that the trap handler is disabled, only for it to be enabled later, leading to an inconsistent and insecure state.

### 3. V8 Sandbox Registration

-   **`RegisterV8Sandbox()` and `gSandboxRecordsHead`**: This file also manages a simple linked list of memory regions that constitute the V8 Sandbox. The "inside" handler uses this list to quickly determine if a faulting memory access was targeting an address within the sandbox. This information is crucial for the handler to correctly diagnose the fault.

### 4. The Landing Pad

-   **`SetLandingPad()` and `gLandingPad`**: This function sets a global variable that tells the "inside" handler where to redirect execution to after a fault has been safely handled. The `gLandingPad` is the pre-arranged "safe place" for execution to resume, avoiding the faulting instruction and allowing V8 to handle the out-of-bounds access in a controlled manner. The integrity of this pointer is essential for a safe recovery.

## Summary of Security Posture

`handler-outside.cc` is the trusted foundation of the trap handler mitigation. It doesn't handle traps itself, but it provides the trusted data that the actual handler relies on.

-   **Security Criticality**: Its security rests on the guarantee that the metadata it provides to the "inside" handler is always accurate and consistent.
-   **Primary Risks**:
    -   **Data Corruption**: A bug in the registration/unregistration logic or a failure in the `MetadataLock` could lead to corrupted `CodeProtectionInfo`, causing the handler to misinterpret a legitimate or malicious fault.
    -   **State Mismatch**: A bug in the `EnableTrapHandler` logic could lead to the handler being active when other parts of the engine don't expect it to be, or vice-versa.
-   **Audit Focus**: When analyzing this file, the primary focus should be on thread safety, the correctness of the data structure management (especially the freelist logic for `gCodeObjects`), and the integrity of the pointers provided (like `gLandingPad`).
