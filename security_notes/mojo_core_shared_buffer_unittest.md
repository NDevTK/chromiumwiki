# Security Notes: `mojo/core/shared_buffer_unittest.cc`

## File Overview

This file contains unit tests for Mojo's shared buffer implementation. While test files do not contain production logic, they are invaluable for a security researcher as they explicitly state the expected behavior and security guarantees of the feature under test. These tests verify the core functionalities of creating, duplicating, passing, and accessing shared memory buffers, which are fundamental primitives for efficient Inter-Process Communication (IPC) in Chromium.

## Key Security Properties Verified by Tests

The tests in this file validate several critical security properties of Mojo shared buffers:

### 1. Enforcement of Read-Only Permissions

This is the most significant security feature demonstrated in these tests. The ability to share memory from a higher-privileged process to a lower-privileged one without allowing the latter to modify it is a cornerstone of the Chromium sandbox model.

-   **Tests**: `MAYBE_CreateAndPassReadOnlyBuffer`, `MAYBE_CreateAndPassFromChildReadOnlyBuffer`.
-   **Mechanism**: The tests call `DuplicateBuffer(b, true /* read_only */)`. This creates a new handle to the same shared buffer but with restricted permissions.
-   **Verification**: The receiving process, running the `ReadAndMapWriteSharedBuffer` client, explicitly checks that the underlying memory region is read-only. It does this by getting the native `PlatformSharedMemoryRegion` and asserting its mode is `kReadOnly`.
    ```cpp
    // In the child process:
    auto buffer = ipcz_driver::SharedBuffer::Unbox(b);
    EXPECT_EQ(buffer->region().GetMode(),
              base::subtle::PlatformSharedMemoryRegion::Mode::kReadOnly);
    ```
-   **Security Implication**: This test suite provides high confidence that if the browser process creates data and passes a read-only buffer handle to a sandboxed renderer process, the renderer process is prevented by the operating system from modifying that memory. This is essential for preventing a compromised renderer from corrupting data structures in the browser process.

### 2. Memory Integrity Across Multiple Processes

The tests verify that data remains consistent when a shared buffer handle is passed through complex process hierarchies.

-   **Tests**: `MAYBE_PassSharedBufferCrossProcess`, `MAYBE_PassSharedBufferFromChildToChild`, `MAYBE_PassHandleBetweenCousins`.
-   **Mechanism**: These tests spawn multiple child processes. A buffer is created in one process, its handle is passed through one or more other processes, and finally, the data is written or read in a different process from where it was created.
-   **Verification**: The parent process or a designated child process asserts that the final contents of the buffer match what was expected to be written (`ExpectBufferContents(b, 0, message)`).
-   **Security Implication**: This confirms the robustness of handle passing and shared memory mapping across different security domains. It ensures that the underlying IPC mechanism doesn't corrupt handles or memory mappings, which could otherwise lead to memory access bugs or information leaks.

### 3. Handle Lifecycle and Scoping

Throughout the tests, Mojo handles (`MojoHandle`) are created, passed, and explicitly closed using `MojoClose()`.

-   **Security Implication**: While not testing a specific security feature, the consistent and correct handling of the resource lifecycle is a prerequisite for a secure system. These tests demonstrate the intended pattern of use, ensuring that handles are not leaked. Leaked handles could lead to resource exhaustion, and use-after-close could lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## Summary of Security Posture

The `shared_buffer_unittest.cc` file provides strong evidence for the security of Mojo's shared memory implementation. For a security researcher, it confirms:

-   The **primary mechanism for safe data sharing** from privileged to unprivileged processes is the creation of **read-only buffer handles**. The tests verify that this restriction is correctly applied at the OS level.
-   The IPC system is robust enough to maintain memory and handle integrity even in **complex multi-process scenarios**, which is critical for the browser's architecture.
-   It provides a clear blueprint for how to use the `DuplicateBuffer` API to create read-only handles, which is a key API for any developer writing secure code that involves sharing memory with a less-trusted process.
