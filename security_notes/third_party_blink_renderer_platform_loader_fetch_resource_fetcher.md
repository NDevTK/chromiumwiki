# Security Notes for `third_party/blink/renderer/platform/loader/fetch/resource_fetcher.cc`

The `ResourceFetcher` is the primary engine within the Blink rendering engine for fetching all subresources required by a document. This includes images, scripts, stylesheets, fonts, and data fetched via `fetch()`. It sits at a critical junction, acting as the renderer-side gatekeeper that applies numerous security policies before dispatching a request to the network service. Its correct operation is fundamental to the security of the renderer process and the enforcement of the web's security model.

## Core Security Responsibilities

1.  **Security Policy Enforcement**: `ResourceFetcher` is the primary point of enforcement for many critical security policies within the renderer process. Before a request is sent to the browser process, it performs checks for:
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: It calls into the `ContentSecurityPolicy` object to check if a resource load is permitted by the document's policy.
    *   **Mixed Content**: It checks for and blocks insecure content (e.g., an `http://` image) being loaded on a secure page (`https://`).
    *   **Referrer Policy**: It determines the correct `Referer` header to send based on the document's `Referrer-Policy`.
    *   **Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB/ORB)**: While the final blocking happens in the network service, the `ResourceFetcher` sets up the request with the correct destination and mode, which are essential inputs for Opaque Response Blocking (ORB).

2.  **Cache Management and Partitioning**: The `ResourceFetcher` interacts heavily with the in-memory `MemoryCache`.
    *   **Cache Keying**: The `GetCacheIdentifier` method is a critical security function. It generates a cache key that includes the ID of the controlling Service Worker or the token of the Web Bundle. This **partitions the memory cache**, ensuring that a resource fetched by one context (e.g., under Service Worker A) cannot be read from the cache by another context (e.g., Service Worker B), preventing cross-origin information leaks.
    *   **Revalidation Logic**: `DetermineRevalidationPolicy` decides whether a cached resource can be used directly, must be revalidated with the server (`If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`), or must be completely reloaded. A bug in this logic could cause a stale or incorrect resource to be served, potentially bypassing security updates or policies.

3.  **Request Initiation and Prioritization**:
    *   It is responsible for creating a `ResourceLoader` for each request, which in turn communicates with the `URLLoader` in the network service.
    *   It computes the request's priority (`ComputeLoadPriority`). While primarily a performance feature, incorrect prioritization could potentially be abused to create side-channel attacks or denial-of-service conditions.

4.  **Preload and Prefetch Handling**:
    *   `ResourceFetcher` manages resources preloaded via `<link rel="preload">`. The logic in `MatchPreload` is security-sensitive, as it must ensure that a subsequent request for a resource perfectly matches the preloaded one in terms of security properties (e.g., CORS mode, integrity metadata).
    *   A failure to correctly match could lead to an integrity check being bypassed or a resource being used in a context for which it was not intended.

## Security-Critical Logic

*   **`RequestResource`**: This is the main entry point. It orchestrates all the steps: checking security policies, consulting the cache, and finally creating and starting a `ResourceLoader`. The correctness of the sequence of operations here is paramount.
*   **`ResourcePrepareHelper`**: This inner class encapsulates the initial setup of a request. It's where critical checks like CSP are performed (`CheckAndEnforceCSPForRequest`). Any logic that can cause these checks to be skipped would be a serious vulnerability.
*   **`DetermineRevalidationPolicyInternal`**: This method contains the complex decision tree for cache revalidation. It checks for `Cache-Control: no-store`, `Vary` header mismatches, and other conditions. A flaw here could lead to improper caching behavior.
*   **`StartLoad`**: This method ultimately creates the `ResourceLoader`. It's responsible for setting up the loader with the correct security context and parameters derived from the `FetchParameters`.

## Potential Attack Surface and Research Areas

*   **Bypassing Security Policies**: The primary attack surface is finding a way to craft a resource request that bypasses one of the security checks.
    *   Could a specific combination of request attributes (e.g., a certain `ResourceType`, initiator, and redirect chain) cause a CSP check to be skipped?
    *   Could a malformed URL or header cause the referrer policy logic to misfire and leak a sensitive referrer?
*   **Cache Poisoning and Partitioning Bypass**:
    *   Is there any way to manipulate the `GetCacheIdentifier` logic to cause a cache key collision between two different security contexts? This would be a major cache-partitioning bypass.
    *   Can an attacker poison the in-memory cache with a malformed resource that is later served to a legitimate request, causing parsing errors or other issues?
*   **Preload-Matching Vulnerabilities**: An attacker might try to preload a resource with a weak integrity hash and then trigger a real request for the same URL without an integrity check, hoping that `MatchPreload` incorrectly serves the weakly-verified resource.
*   **State Confusion**: The `ResourceFetcher` is a complex, stateful object. A sequence of operations (e.g., starting a request, detaching the context with `ClearContext`, then re-attaching) could potentially lead to a confused state where security properties are inconsistent.

In summary, the `ResourceFetcher` is the renderer's trusted agent for network access. It is the last line of defense for many security policies before a request is sent to the more privileged browser and network processes. Its security relies on the rigorous and correct application of checks for every single subresource request initiated by a web page or worker.
