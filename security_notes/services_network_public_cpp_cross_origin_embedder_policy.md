# Security Analysis of `services/network/public/cpp/cross_origin_embedder_policy.cc`

## Summary

This file defines the `CrossOriginEmbedderPolicy` class, which is the C++ representation of the Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP) delivered by a web server. While the class itself is a relatively simple data structure, it is the foundation upon which one of the web's most powerful security features is built. The value of this class determines whether a document can enter a "cross-origin isolated" state, which is a prerequisite for using sensitive APIs like `SharedArrayBuffer` and for protecting against speculative execution attacks like Spectre.

## The Core Security Principle: Opt-In to Isolation

The Cross-Origin Embedder Policy is a defense-in-depth mechanism that allows a web page to declare that it is unwilling to load cross-origin resources that have not explicitly granted permission to be embedded. This is a powerful security posture because it mitigates the risk of loading untrusted, opaque resources that could be co-opted by an attacker in a side-channel attack.

The `CrossOriginEmbedderPolicy` class encapsulates the state of this policy, primarily through its `value` member, which can be one of:

*   **`kNone`**: The default, non-isolated state.
*   **`kCredentialless`**: A less strict form of isolation that allows loading of cross-origin resources, but strips their credentials (e.g., cookies).
*   **`kRequireCorp`**: The strictest form, requiring all cross-origin resources to be served with a `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` header.

## `CompatibleWithCrossOriginIsolated`: The Security Gatekeeper

The most important security logic in this file is the `CompatibleWithCrossOriginIsolated` function. This function is the gatekeeper that determines whether a given COEP value is strong enough to enable the coveted cross-origin isolated state.

```cpp
bool CompatibleWithCrossOriginIsolated(
    mojom::CrossOriginEmbedderPolicyValue value) {
  switch (value) {
    case mojom::CrossOriginEmbedderPolicyValue::kNone:
      return false;
    case mojom::CrossOriginEmbedderPolicyValue::kCredentialless:
    case mojom::CrossOriginEmbedderPolicyValue::kRequireCorp:
      return true;
  }
}
```

This function is the single point of truth for this critical security decision. By returning `true` only for `kCredentialless` and `kRequireCorp`, it ensures that:

1.  **Isolation is Explicit**: A document cannot become cross-origin isolated by accident. The server must explicitly send a COEP header with a value other than `kNone`.
2.  **No Weak States**: There are no "in-between" states that could provide a false sense of security. A document is either compatible with isolation or it is not.
3.  **Future-Proofing**: If new COEP values are added in the future, they will default to being non-compatible unless they are explicitly added to this function. This is a secure "fail-closed" design.

## The Role of the Network Service

It is significant that this code resides in `services/network`. The COEP header is parsed and the `CrossOriginEmbedderPolicy` object is constructed in the sandboxed network service process. This means that the initial handling of the header is done in a low-privilege environment. The resulting, validated `CrossOriginEmbedderPolicy` object is then passed to the browser process, which uses it to make security decisions (e.g., what process to put the document in, which APIs to enable). This follows the principle of parsing untrusted data in the most restricted environment possible.

## Conclusion

The `CrossOriginEmbedderPolicy` class and its associated `CompatibleWithCrossOriginIsolated` function are the foundational building blocks of the cross-origin isolation security feature. They provide a clear, unambiguous representation of a document's embedder policy and a single, authoritative function for determining if that policy is strong enough to unlock powerful but sensitive web platform features. The security of features like `SharedArrayBuffer` rests on the correctness and strictness of this seemingly simple component.
