# Security Analysis of `services/network/public/cpp/cross_origin_embedder_policy_parser.cc`

## Summary

This file contains the parser for the `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` (COEP) and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy-Report-Only` HTTP headers. This is a security-critical function because it is the boundary where untrusted text sent by a web server is converted into a structured C++ object (`CrossOriginEmbedderPolicy`) that the browser uses to make high-stakes security decisions. A bug in this parser could lead to a misinterpretation of a server's intended policy, potentially disabling the cross-origin isolated state and exposing the user to side-channel attacks like Spectre.

## The Core Security Principle: Strict Parsing of Structured Headers

The key to the security of this parser is its strict adherence to the Structured Headers specification (RFC 8941). The `Parse` function uses `net::structured_headers::ParseItem`, which is a robust, security-hardened parser designed to handle the complexities of HTTP header values.

```cpp
// from Parse()
const auto item = net::structured_headers::ParseItem(header_value);
if (!item || item->item.Type() != net::structured_headers::Item::kTokenType) {
  return {
      mojom::CrossOriginEmbedderPolicyValue::kNone,
      std::nullopt,
  };
}
```

This has several important security benefits:

1.  **Default to a Safe State**: If the header value is not a valid Structured Headers "Item", or if the item is not a "token" (as required by the COEP spec), the parser immediately and safely defaults to `kNone`. This is a "fail-safe" or "fail-closed" design. An invalid or malformed header will never accidentally enable a more privileged security context.

2.  **No Ambiguous Interpretations**: The Structured Headers parser is designed to be unambiguous. It eliminates the possibility of parsing bugs that could arise from trying to manually parse complex, comma-delimited, or quoted strings. This prevents attacks where a server might try to craft a malicious header that is interpreted one way by Chromium and another way by a proxy or firewall.

3.  **Centralized Parsing Logic**: By relying on the `net::structured_headers` library, the security of COEP parsing is tied to the security of a single, well-vetted component that is used across the entire networking stack. This reduces the attack surface and makes the code easier to audit.

## Handling of Policy Values

The parser correctly identifies the two valid tokens for enabling cross-origin isolation:

*   `"require-corp"`
*   `"credentialless"`

If the parsed token is anything else, the parser correctly defaults to `kNone`. There is no "allow list" of invalid tokens that might be misinterpreted; the logic is a strict "deny list" of everything except the two known-good values.

## Parsing Both Enforced and Report-Only Headers

The top-level function, `ParseCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy`, correctly handles the presence of both the enforcing (`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`) and the report-only (`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy-Report-Only`) headers. It parses each one independently and populates the corresponding fields in the `CrossOriginEmbedderPolicy` object. This separation is critical, as it ensures that a report-only policy cannot be misinterpreted as an enforced policy.

## Conclusion

The `cross_origin_embedder_policy_parser.cc` is a model of secure parser design. Its security rests on two key principles: the use of a robust, centralized Structured Headers library and a strict "fail-safe" design that defaults to the most secure state (`kNone`) in the face of any ambiguity or error. This ensures that a web page can only enter the privileged, cross-origin isolated state if the server sends a perfectly well-formed and valid COEP header.
