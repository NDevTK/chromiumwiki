# Security Notes: `components/password_manager/core/browser/password_store/login_database.cc`

## File Overview

This file implements the `LoginDatabase`, the lowest-level component responsible for persisting credentials to a SQLite database on disk. This is the final destination for password data within the browser process. As such, its implementation is critical for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of stored credentials. This class handles all direct SQL database interactions, data serialization, and the application of encryption before writing to disk.

## Key Security Mechanisms and Patterns

### 1. Secure Database Schema and Migration

The file defines the schema for the `logins` table and several related tables. The security and integrity of this schema are maintained through a robust versioning and migration system.

-   **`kCurrentVersionNumber` / `kCompatibleVersionNumber`**: These constants define the database schema version. This prevents newer versions of Chrome from being downgraded and having their database corrupted by an older version that doesn't understand the schema.
-   **`MigrateDatabase()`**: This function contains the logic to upgrade an older database schema to the current version. It handles adding, renaming, and dropping columns.
-   **`SQLTableBuilder`**: The migration logic doesn't use raw SQL `ALTER TABLE` commands. Instead, it uses the `SQLTableBuilder` class, which provides a safer, more abstract way to specify schema changes, reducing the risk of mistakes in the migration code.
-   **Security Implication**: A robust migration path is essential for long-term security. It ensures that as security features are added (e.g., new metadata for passwords), the database can be updated without losing or corrupting existing user data.

### 2. Encryption at the Point of Storage

This class is the boundary where password data transitions from plaintext in memory to ciphertext on disk.

-   **`EncryptedString()` / `DecryptedString()`**: These are the two most security-sensitive methods in the file.
    -   `AddLogin()` and `UpdateLogin()` call `EncryptedString()` on the password value before binding it to the SQL statement.
    -   `StatementToForms()` calls `DecryptedString()` on the blob retrieved from the database to convert it back to a plaintext password in memory.
-   **Delegation to Platform-Specific Cryptography**: A critical security design choice is that this file **does not contain any cryptographic primitives**. The actual encryption/decryption is delegated to platform-specific implementations (e.g., `login_database_win.cc`, `login_database_mac.cc`) which, in turn, use the operating system's native credential storage (DPAPI, Keychain, etc.). This is a strong pattern, as it leverages the most secure storage mechanism available on the host OS.
-   **`os_crypt_async::Encryptor`**: The backend provides an `Encryptor` object, which is used for all cryptographic operations. This ensures that the encryption key management is handled by a dedicated, secure service.

### 3. SQL Injection Prevention

All database queries are constructed using `sql::Statement` and parameterized bindings.

-   **Mechanism**: Instead of concatenating strings to build SQL queries, the code uses `?` placeholders (e.g., `DELETE FROM logins WHERE id=?`). Values are then bound to these placeholders using methods like `s.BindString()` or `s.BindInt()`.
-   **Security Implication**: This is the industry-standard, best-practice defense against SQL injection vulnerabilities. By strictly separating the SQL command from the data, it makes it impossible for user-controlled data (like a username or a URL) to be misinterpreted as part of the SQL command itself.

### 4. Robust Transaction Management

All write operations (`AddLogin`, `UpdateLogin`, `RemoveLogin`) are wrapped in `sql::Transaction`.

-   **Mechanism**: The `ScopedTransaction` helper class ensures that `db_->BeginTransaction()` is called at the start of an operation and `db_->CommitTransaction()` is called at the end.
-   **Security Implication**: This guarantees the atomicity of database operations. If an error occurs midway through a multi-step operation (e.g., updating a login and its associated metadata), the entire transaction is rolled back, preventing the database from being left in a corrupt or inconsistent state.

### 5. Handling of Undecryptable Passwords

The database has a specific and important flow for handling passwords that can no longer be decrypted (e.g., because the user's OS account password changed, invalidating the encryption key).

-   **`DeleteUndecryptableLogins()`**: This function is called when a decryption failure is detected. It iterates through all stored logins, attempts to decrypt each one, and if it fails, it deletes that specific entry from the database.
-   **`ShouldDeleteUndecryptablePasswords()`**: This function implements a set of safety checks to prevent accidental data loss. For example, it will not delete undecryptable passwords if it detects that the user's profile directory has been moved or if encryption is temporarily unavailable, as these situations might be recoverable.
-   **Security Implication**: This is a critical data hygiene and security feature. It prevents the accumulation of "zombie" credentials that are unusable by the user but could potentially be decrypted by an attacker who gains access to an old OS key. By deleting them, it enforces a "fail-safe" state.

## Summary of Security Posture

The `LoginDatabase` is a well-designed and hardened component.

-   **Security Model**: It follows the principle of secure by design, using industry-standard practices for all of its core functions: parameterized queries to prevent SQLi, OS-level delegation for encryption, and transactional integrity for all writes.
-   **Primary Risks**:
    -   **Migration Bugs**: The most complex part of the code is the schema migration logic. A bug here could lead to data loss or corruption during a browser update.
    -   **Encryption Key Management**: The security of the entire database ultimately rests on the security of the OS-level encryption keys. Any vulnerability in the OS that exposes these keys would compromise the password store.
-   **Audit Focus**: A security review of this file should focus on the correctness of the SQL statements, the logic within the `MigrateDatabase` function, and the handling of return values from the encryption/decryption functions to ensure that no error condition can lead to an insecure state.
